This repository contains an implementation of the K-Means Clustering algorithm, a popular unsupervised learning method used to partition data into clusters.
The K-means algorithm is widely used in fields such as data mining, image processing, and pattern recognition.

Overview
K-means is a clustering algorithm that aims to divide a dataset into K clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. 
The goal is to minimize the variance within each cluster and separate data points into groups based on their similarity.

Features
Customizable Number of Clusters: Set the number of clusters (K) based on the requirements of the data.
Initialization: Selects initial centroids using random initialization or the K-means++ method to improve convergence.
Iterative Optimization: Alternates between assigning points to the nearest centroid and updating centroids to the mean of assigned points.
Convergence Criteria: Stops the iteration when centroids no longer move significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
Implementation Details
Random Initialization: Choose K random points as initial centroids or use K-means++ for smarter initialization.
Assignment Step: For each point, compute the distance to each centroid and assign the point to the closest centroid.
Update Step: Update each centroid to be the mean of points assigned to it.
Convergence Check: Repeat the assignment and update steps until the centroids stabilize or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
